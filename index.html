    <p>George Lucas thought the scene between <strong>Han Solo</strong> and Greedo in the cantina made Han look cold blooded. Let's think about the origninal scene, shall we? Greedo the bounty hunter is holding Han at gunpoint and says in his gurgly he is going to kill him. Han shoots Greedo through the table before Greedo can blow Han a new smuggling hatch. That makes Han <em>cool</em> , not cold.</p>
